Napoleon Bonaparte (born Napoleone di Buonaparte;[1][b] 15 
August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name
Napoleon I, was a French emperor and military commander who 
rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led 
successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. 
He was the leader of the French Republic as First Consul 
from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as
Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and briefly 
again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures 
as a celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many 
enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian 
rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders 
in history and his wars and campaigns are still studied at military 
schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was 
responsible for the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six 
million people died.[2][3]

Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica into a family descended 
from Italian nobility.[4][5] He was resentful of the French monarchy, 
and supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French 
army, trying to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly 
in the ranks after saving the governing French Directory by firing on 
royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against the 
Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories, and 
became a national hero. Two years later he led a military expedition 
to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He 
engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the
 Republic. In 1804, to consolidate and expand his power, he crowned 
himself Emperor of the French.

Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the 
Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories 
in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the 
dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took 
up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and 
Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and defeated the 
Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the 
Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the 
Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, 
but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the 
Battle of Wagram.

Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, 
Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph 
the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the 
Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's 
marshals. Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. 
The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's 
Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a 
Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army 
defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded 
France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. 
He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. 
In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.

Napoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] 
The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated 
Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled 
him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he 
died in 1821 at the age of 51.

Napoleon had a lasting impact on the world, bringing modernizing 
reforms to France and Western Europe[c] and stimulating the development 
of nation states. He also sold the Louisiana Territory to the United 
States in 1803, doubling the size of the United States.[2][13] However, 
his mixed record on civil rights and exploitation of conquered 
territories adversely affect his reputation.[d]

Early life

Napoleon's father, Carlo Buonaparte, fought for Corsican independence under 
Pasquale Paoli, but after their defeat he eventually became the island's 
representative to the court of Louis XVI.
Napoleon's family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the 
Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family that emigrated to 
Corsica in the 16th century and his maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended 
from a minor Genoese noble family.[18] His parents Carlo Maria Buonaparte and Maria 
Letizia Ramolino maintained a home in Ajaccio where Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769. 
He was the family's fourth child and third son.[e] He had an elder brother, Joseph, and 
younger siblings Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme. Napoleon was baptized 
as a Catholic, under the name Napoleone.[19] In his youth, his name was also spelled as Nabulione, 
Nabulio, Napolionne, and Napulione.[20]

Napoleon was born one year after the Republic of Genoa ceded Corsica to France.[21] 
The state sold sovereign rights a year before his birth and the island was conquered 
by France during the year of his birth. It was formally incorporated as a province in 
1770, after 500 years under Genoese rule and 14 years of independence.[f] Napoleon's 
parents joined the Corsican resistance and fought against the French to maintain independence, 
even when Maria was pregnant with him. His father Carlo was an attorney who had supported and 
actively collaborated with patriot Pasquale Paoli during the Corsican war of independence 
against France;[5] after the Corsican defeat at Ponte Novu in 1769 and Paoli's exile in Britain, 
Carlo began working for the new French government and in 1777 was named representative of 
the island to the court of Louis XVI.[5][25]

The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline 
restrained a rambunctious child.[25] Later in life, Napoleon said, "The future destiny 
of the child is always the work of the mother."[26] His maternal grandmother had married 
into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal 
Joseph Fesch, fulfilled a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years. Napoleon's 
noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were 
available to a typical Corsican of the time.[27]

When he turned 9 years old, Napoleon moved to the French mainland and enrolled at a religious 
school in Autun in January 1779. In May, he transferred with a scholarship to a military academy 
at Brienne-le-Château.[28] In his youth, he was an outspoken Corsican nationalist and supported 
the state's independence from France.[29][30] Like many Corsicans, Napoleon spoke and read 
Corsican (as his mother tongue) and Italian (as the official language of Corsica).[31][32][33][30] 
He began learning French in school at the age of around 10.[34] Although he became fluent in French,
 he spoke with a distinctive Corsican accent and never learned to spell in French.[35] Consequently, 
Napoleon was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent, birthplace, short stature, mannerisms, and 
inability to speak French quickly.[32] He became reserved and melancholy, applying himself to reading.
An examiner observed that Napoleon "has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics. 
He is fairly well acquainted with history and geography ... This boy would make an excellent sailor".[g][37]

One story told of Napoleon at the school is that he led junior students to victory against senior 
students in a snowball fight, showing his leadership abilities.[38] In early adulthood, Napoleon 
briefly intended to become a writer; he authored a history of Corsica and a romantic novella.[29]

On completion of his studies at Brienne in 1784, Napoleon was admitted to the École militaire in 
Paris. He trained to become an artillery officer and, when his father's death reduced his income, 
was forced to complete the two-year course in one year.[39] He was the first Corsican to graduate 
from the École militaire.[39] He was examined by the famed scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace.[40]

Early career

Upon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère 
artillery regiment.[h][28] He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the 
French Revolution in 1789. Bonaparte was a fervent Corsican nationalist during this period.
[42] He asked for leave to join his mentor Pasquale Paoli, when Paoli was allowed to return 
to Corsica by the National Assembly. But Paoli had no sympathy for Napoleon, as he deemed 
his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence.[43]

He spent the early years of the Revolution in Corsica, fighting in a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists. Napoleon embraced the ideals of the Revolution, becoming a supporter of the Jacobins and joining the pro-French Corsican Republicans who opposed Paoli's policy and his aspirations to secede.[44] He was given command over a battalion of volunteers and promoted to captain in the regular army in 1792, despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against French troops.[45]

When Corsica declared formal secession from France and requested the protection of the British government, Napoleon and his commitment to the French Revolution came into conflict with Paoli, who had decided to sabotage the Corsican contribution to the Expédition de Sardaigne by preventing a French assault on the Sardinian island La Maddalena.[46] Bonaparte and his family were compelled to flee to Toulon on the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli.[28]

Although he was born "Napoleone Buonaparte", it was after this that Napoleon began styling himself "Napoléon Bonaparte". His family did not drop the name Buonaparte until 1796. The first known record of him signing his name as Bonaparte was at the age of 27 (in 1796).[47][19][48]

Siege of Toulon

Bonaparte at the Siege of Toulon, 1793, by Edouard Detaille
In July 1793, Bonaparte published a pro-republican pamphlet, Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire), which gained him the support of Augustin Robespierre, the younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre. With the help of his fellow Corsican Antoine Christophe Saliceti, Bonaparte was appointed senior gunner and artillery commander of the republican forces that arrived at Toulon on 8 September.[49][50]

He adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbour and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position led to the capture of the city, and during it Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh on 16 December. Catching the attention of the Committee of Public Safety, he was put in charge of the artillery of France's Army of Italy.[51] On 22 December he was on his way to a new post in Nice, promoted from colonel to brigadier general at the age of 24. He devised plans to attack the Kingdom of Sardinia as part of France's campaign against the First Coalition.

The French army carried out Bonaparte's plan in the Battle of Saorgio in April 1794, and then advanced to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, it headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte on a mission to the Republic of Genoa to determine the country's intentions towards France.[52]

13 Vendémiaire
Main article: 13 Vendémiaire
Some contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under house arrest at Nice for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794.[53] Bonaparte's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy, with whom Bonaparte was seconded at the time. Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defence in a letter to the commissar Saliceti, and was acquitted of any wrongdoing.[54] He was released within two weeks (on 20 August), and due to his technical skills, was asked to draw up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria. He also took part in an expedition to take back Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the British Royal Navy.[55]

From 1794, Napoleon was in a romantic relationship with Désirée Clary. Désirée's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's brother Joseph.[56][57] In April 1795, Napoleon was assigned to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west-central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.[58]

He was moved to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety. He sought unsuccessfully to be transferred to Constantinople to offer his services to the Sultan.[59] During this period, he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eugénie, about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Clary.[60] On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for refusing to serve in the Vendée campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.[61]

On 3 October, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention.[62] Paul Barras, a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction, knew of Bonaparte's military exploits at Toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the convention in the Tuileries Palace. Bonaparte had seen the massacre of the King's Swiss Guard there three years earlier and realized that artillery would be the key to its defence.[28]

He ordered a young cavalry officer, Joachim Murat, to seize large cannons and used them to repel the attackers on 5 October 1795—13 Vendémiaire An IV in the French Republican Calendar. 1,400 royalists died and the rest fled.[62] He cleared the streets with "a whiff of grapeshot", according to 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle in The French Revolution: A History.[63][64]

The defeat of the royalist insurrection extinguished the threat to the Convention and earned Bonaparte sudden fame, wealth, and the patronage of the new government, the Directory. Murat married one of Bonaparte's sisters; he also served as one of Bonaparte's generals. Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy.[28]

Within weeks, he was romantically involved with Joséphine de Beauharnais, the former mistress of Barras. The couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony.[65]

First Italian campaign

Two days after the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861) before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign, he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Bonaparte defeated every relief effort, winning the battles of Castiglione, Bassano, Arcole, and Rivoli. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.[66]

The next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the Habsburg heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the Archduke Charles in 1796, but Charles withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning of Bonaparte's assault. In the first encounter between the two, Bonaparte pushed Charles back and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to Leoben, about 100 km from Vienna, and decided to sue for peace.[67]

The Treaty of Leoben, followed by the more comprehensive Treaty of Campo Formio, gave France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries, and a secret clause promised the Republic of Venice to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of Venetian independence. He authorized the French to loot treasures such as the Horses of Saint Mark.[68]

In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 standards.[69] The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 pitched battles through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.[70]

During the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and one for circulation in France.[71] The royalists attacked him for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.[72] Bonaparte's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels. His forces confiscated more than 300 priceless paintings and sculptures.[73]

Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on 4 September—the Coup of 18 Fructidor. This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent upon Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria. These negotiations resulted in the Treaty of Campo Formio. Bonaparte returned to Paris on 5 December 1797 as a hero.[74] He met Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister—who served in the same capacity for Emperor Napoleon—and they began to prepare to invade Britain.[28]

Egyptian expedition

After two months of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval strength was not yet sufficient to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided on a military expedition to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India.[28] Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East and join forces with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore, an enemy of the British.[75] Bonaparte assured the Directory that "as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions".[76] The Directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to the Indian subcontinent.[77]

In May 1798, Bonaparte was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences. His Egyptian expedition included a group of 167 scientists, with mathematicians, naturalists, chemists, and geodesists among them. Their discoveries included the Rosetta Stone, and their work was published in the Description de l'Égypte in 1809.[78] En route to Egypt, Bonaparte reached Malta on 9 June 1798, then controlled by the Knights Hospitaller. Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim surrendered after token resistance, and Bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men.[79]

Bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the Royal Navy and landed at Alexandria on 1 July.[28] He fought the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks, Egypt's ruling military caste. This helped the French practise their defensive tactic for the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July, about 24 km (15 mi) from the pyramids. Bonaparte's forces of 25,000 roughly equalled those of the Mamluks' Egyptian cavalry. Twenty-nine French[80] and approximately 2,000 Egyptians were killed. The victory boosted the French army's morale.[81]

On 1 August 1798, the British fleet under Sir Horatio Nelson captured or destroyed all but two vessels of the French fleet in the Battle of the Nile, preventing Bonaparte from strengthening the French position in the Mediterranean.[82] His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt, though it faced repeated uprisings.[83] In early 1799, he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus (Syria and Galilee). Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa.[84] The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal. Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war, ostensibly on parole, so he ordered the garrison and some 1,500–5,000 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning.[85][86][87] Men, women, and children were robbed and murdered for three days.[88]

Bonaparte began with an army of 13,000 men. 1,500 were reported missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed the retreat, Bonaparte was alleged to have ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium.[89] Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.[90]

While in Egypt, Bonaparte stayed informed of European affairs. He learned that France had suffered a series of defeats in the War of the Second Coalition.[91] On 24 August 1799, fearing that the Republic's future was in doubt, he took advantage of the temporary departure of British ships from French coastal ports and set sail for France, despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from Paris.[92] The army was left in the charge of Jean-Baptiste Kléber.[93]

Unknown to Bonaparte, the Directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of French soil, but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages.[91] By the time that he reached Paris in October, France's situation had been improved by a series of victories. The Republic, however, was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population.[94] The Directory discussed Bonaparte's "desertion" but was too weak to punish him.[91]

Despite the failures in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome. He drew together an alliance with Talleyrand and members of the Council of Five Hundred: Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, his brother Lucien, Roger Ducos and Joseph Fouché. They overthrew the Directory by a coup d'état on 9 November 1799 ("the 18th Brumaire" according to the revolutionary calendar), closing down the Council of Five Hundred. Napoleon became "first consul" for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only. His power was confirmed by the new "Constitution of the Year VIII", originally devised by Sieyès to give Napoleon a minor role, but rewritten by Napoleon, and accepted by direct popular vote (3,000,000 in favour, 1,567 opposed). The constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but, in reality, established a dictatorship.[95][96]

Bonaparte established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons called "dictatorship by plebiscite".[97] Worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution, but unwilling to ignore them entirely, Bonaparte resorted to regular electoral consultations with the French people on his road to imperial power.[97] He drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul, taking up residence at the Tuileries. The constitution was approved in a rigged plebiscite held the following January, with 99.94 percent officially listed as voting "yes".[98]

Napoleon's brother, Lucien, had falsified the returns to show that 3 million people had participated in the plebiscite. The real number was 1.5 million.[97] Political observers at the time assumed the eligible French voting public numbered about 5 million people, so the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to indicate popular enthusiasm for the consulate.[97] In the first few months of the consulate, with war in Europe still raging and internal instability still plaguing the country, Bonaparte's grip on power remained very tenuous.[99]

In the spring of 1800, Bonaparte and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Bonaparte was still in Egypt.[i] After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed.[101] While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern force some time to carry out their operations with little interference.[102]

After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies collided at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Bonaparte commanded 24,000 French troops.[103] The battle began favourably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas stated that he had won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French.[104] The French lines never broke during their tactical retreat. Bonaparte constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight.[105]


The Battle of Marengo was Napoleon's first major victory as head of state.
Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and cavalry charges decimated the Austrian army, which fled over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties.[105] The following day, the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region.[105]

Although critics have blamed Bonaparte for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline.[106] As David G. Chandler points out, Bonaparte spent almost a year getting the Austrians out of Italy in his first campaign. In 1800, it took him only a month to achieve the same goal.[106] German strategist and field marshal Alfred von Schlieffen concluded that "Bonaparte did not annihilate his enemy but eliminated him and rendered him harmless" while attaining "the object of the campaign: the conquest of North Italy".[107]

Bonaparte's triumph at Marengo secured his political authority and boosted his popularity back home, but it did not lead to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in Lunéville and reported that Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio.[108]

Temporary peace in Europe
See also: Haitian Revolution
After a decade of constant warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories as well as for assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic.[102] With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Bonaparte's popularity soared to its highest levels under the consulate, both domestically and abroad.[109] In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Bonaparte to dictator for life.[109]

Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72 percent of all eligible voters).[110] There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime. The constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote.[110] His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life.[111] After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.[41]


The 1803 Louisiana Purchase totalled 2,144,480 square kilometres (827,987 square miles), doubling the size of the United States.
The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint L'Ouverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw a chance to reestablish control over the colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. In the 18th century, Saint-Domingue had been France's most profitable colony, producing more sugar than all the British West Indies colonies combined. However, during the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794.[112] Aware of the expenses required to fund his wars in Europe, Napoleon made the decision to reinstate slavery in all French Caribbean colonies. The 1794 decree had only affected the colonies of Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and Guiana and did not take effect in Mauritius, Reunion and Martinique, the last of which had been captured by the British and as such remained unaffected by French law.[113]

In Guadeloupe slavery had been abolished (and its ban violently enforced) by Victor Hugues against opposition from slaveholders thanks to the 1794 law. However, when slavery was reinstated in 1802, a slave revolt broke out under the leadership of Louis Delgrès.[114] The resulting Law of 20 May had the express purpose of reinstating slavery in Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and French Guiana, and restored slavery throughout most of the French colonial empire (excluding Saint-Domingue) for another half a century, while the French transatlantic slave trade continued for another twenty years.[115][116][117][118][119]

Napoleon sent an expedition under his brother-in-law General Leclerc to reassert control over Saint-Domingue. Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture, the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army, and Jean-Jacques Dessalines won a string of victories, first against Leclerc, and when he died from yellow fever, then against Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau, whom Napoleon sent to relieve Leclerc with another 20,000 men. In May 1803, Napoleon acknowledged defeat, and the last 8,000 French troops left the island, and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haiti in 1804. In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic France.[120][121] Seeing the failure of his efforts in Haiti, Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States, doubling the size of the U.S. The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre, a total of $15 million.[2][13]

The peace with Britain proved to be uneasy and controversial.[122] Britain did not evacuate Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly.[123] The dispute culminated in a declaration of war by Britain in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne and declaring that every British male between eighteen and sixty years old in France and its dependencies to be arrested as a prisoner of war.[124]

During the consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin assassination plots, including the Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also known as the Infernal Machine) two months later.[125] In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien,[126] violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though he had not been involved in the plot.[127] Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.

To expand his power, Napoleon used these assassination plots to justify the creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was entrenched in the constitution.[128] Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%.[110] As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.[110]

A keen observer of Bonaparte's rise to absolute power, Madame de Rémusat, explains that "men worn out by the turmoil of the Revolution […] looked for the domination of an able ruler" and that "people believed quite sincerely that Bonaparte, whether as consul or emperor, would exert his authority and save [them] from the perils of anarchy."[129][page needed]

Coronation

Napoleon's coronation, at which Pope Pius VII officiated, took place at Notre Dame de Paris, on 2 December 1804.[130] Napoleon wore a golden laurel wreath throughout the proceedings,[131] representing victory, peace and civic virtue.[130] For the coronation, he raised a replica of Charlemagne's crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but did not wear it atop the wreath.[131] All present rose spontaneously, the men waving their hats.[132] Joséphine, Napoleon's wife, knelt in front of him to receive her crown on her head, the event commemorated in the official painting by Jacques-Louis David.[131] Joséphine became only the second queen to be crowned and anointed in French history, other than Marie de' Medici.[133]

Napoleon was then crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on 18 May 1804, the official start of the Empire.[134]

Great Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803.[135] By September 1805, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Naples and the Ottoman Empire had formed a coalition against France.[136][137]

In 1803 and 1804, Napoleon had assembled a force around Boulogne for an invasion of Britain. They never invaded, but the force formed the core of Napoleon's Grande Armée, created in August 1805.[138][139] At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, artillery and cavalry reserves, and the élite Imperial Guard.[140][139] By August 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men,[141] who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.[142]

To facilitate the invasion, Napoleon planned to lure the Royal Navy from the English Channel by a diversionary attack on the British West Indies.[143] However, the plan unravelled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to Cádiz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel.[144]

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, Napoleon abandoned his invasion of England and sought to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian ally could arrive in force. On 25 September, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi).[145][146]

Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered most of the Austrian army at 
the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon's army, however, moved quickly 
and outflanked the Austrian positions. After some minor engagements that 
culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack surrendered. For just 2,000 French 
casualties, Napoleon had captured 60,000 Austrian soldiers through his army's 
rapid marching.[147]
